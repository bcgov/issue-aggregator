# issue-aggregator
The Developers Scrum of Scrum application (DevSOS) has been designed to provide a method for development teams to communicate about issues that are blocking progress. The idea is that, using this tool, a development community can share knowledge, people and tool and help each other move innovation forward. DevSOS joins a variety of tools (JIRA, GitHub, KanBoard as well as Trello) to an aggregated kanban board that highlights blocked issues.
